Man, Squad 36. It’s like I’ve just stumbled out of a thunderstorm, only with explosions and dialogue that tries to outsmart itself but sometimes crashes like my old computer. My back’s killing me from those theater seats, honestly think they’re purposefully uncomfortable just to make me forget the popcorn crumbs everywhere, these little buttery golden stars I’m now wearing on my black jeans like badges of honor.

You know when you accidentally knock a bottle off the table, and it spins around on the floor like it’s deciding if it should break or just settle? That’s Squad 36. Mostly just settles but every now and then smashes into this brilliant hailstorm of action. The lead dude—forgot his name, but he’s got this face that’s kinda like a loaf of bread you put in the oven and forget about. In a good way though, all dramatic cracks and intensity. There was this scene, with helicopters, not sure why, but it felt like watching a cat video on mute and trying to interpret it, you know? Like whaaaat?

> Suddenly remembered someone asking me to download the movie but seriously—what do you even say about a scene where robo-dogs save the day? I mean, HAD to watch the movie in theater cause those barking metal canines deserve the full Dolby digital treatment, like gravel under a snowplow.

A noisy theater, some guy was laughing like he was watching a totally different movie. It’s distracting, like trying to read a novel on a rollercoaster. Oh, god, at one point, some villain monologue felt like a motivational speech if delivered by someone crazy enough to fight a cloud with a sword. Don’t even get me started on how the music played like an old mixtape where every song competes to be louder than the previous, but half of it soundtracks THAT moment when you realize you’ve been wearing your shirt inside out the whole day.

There was this character who talked about pineapple on pizza mid-action sequence. No idea what that was about, but it weirdly worked, like dipping fries into ice cream. Come to think of it, I was supposed to download the movie or maybe someone just wanted to watch the movie again—can’t think why other than those robo-dogs barking like opera singers.
